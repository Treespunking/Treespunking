# üëã Hi, I'm Bello, a Python Developer!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I specialize in building efficient, scalable, and reliable software solutions that span **microservices, data pipelines, intelligent bots, and LLM-powered applications**. My work focuses on solving real-world challenges through automation, data engineering, and AI-driven systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Expertise

üöÄ **Microservices & APIs**
I design and deploy microservices architectures with **FastAPI, Docker, and API Gateway**, ensuring seamless communication, scalability, and maintainability.

üìä **Data Engineering & Pipelines**
From **ETL workflows with dbt, Prefect & Airflow** to **real-time streaming with Kafka, Spark, and Iceberg**, I orchestrate end-to-end pipelines that transform raw data into analytics-ready datasets.

üóÑÔ∏è **Databases & Storage**
Experienced with **PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Weaviate, and AWS S3**, I optimize both structured and unstructured data storage and retrieval.

ü§ñ **Intelligent Automation & Bots**
I build intelligent **Telegram bots** for **inventory management and Nigerian Virtual Top-Up services**, automating tasks and transactions at scale.

üß† **LLM-Powered Applications**
I integrate **LangChain, OpenRouter, and Pydantic** to build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, intelligent parsers, and advanced AI-driven workflows.

üï∏Ô∏è **Web Scraping & Data Extraction**
I automate **large-scale scraping with Playwright and Bright Data**, delivering structured, clean datasets for analytics and decision-making.
